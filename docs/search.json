    "text": "Correcting Field Fluorometer Data Accuracy for Efficient Algal level Monitoring\n\nManatee County Natural Resources Department-Environmental Protection Division; Intern Brendan McKnight\n\n\n\nNarrative\nIn Florida waterways, algae blooms have become a common threat to the environment and the citizens of Florida. Algae blooms release chemicals into the air and water that can harm humans and kill lots of wildlife, therefore, algae level monitoring has become a necessary protocol for environmental agencies. The current method of determining algae levels is not very time and labor efficient and involves taking samples from sites and analyzing them in a lab. Current field equipment has the capabilities to determine algae levels, however it’s accuracy remains an issue due to how it works. This project investigated the accuracy of this equipment and formulated a methodology to be able to gather reliable data on algae levels efficiently while in the field. With this new method, environmental agencies can determine algae levels and respond to them faster, as well as better investigate the causes of these blooms and the best actions to prevent it.\n\n\nAbout\nAn important aspect of water quality is nutrient and algae levels, When there are lots of nutrients in the water, algae populations explode causing harmful algae blooms. It is very important that government and environmental agencies can quickly and accurately monitor levels to take action and inform citizens of dangers to air quality, drinking water, seafood, etc. The Environmental Protection Agency as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fund programs aimed at investigating the ecology, monitoring, event response, and prevention and control of harmful algal blooms. These programs emphasize the importance for scientists to have access to efficient methods of accurate data collection to be able to investigate and respond quickly, as well as to produce more data for better investigation. This project aims to support that same agenda by developing a methodology for using field fluorometers that gives scientists an accurate way to determine the algae level of a waterway without having to take any samples back to a lab for analysis.\nThe Manatee County Natural Resources department has two programs that assess water quality both off the coast of Tampa and Sarasota Bay, as well as in freshwater systems that lead into those bays. These programs are named the Regional Ambient Monitoring Program (RAMP) and Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP). There are 80 sites in total between the two programs where water quality is regularly assessed. Chlorophyll a analysis must be carried out to determine the concentration of algae in the water during these assessments. This involves over 9 different processes from sample event to chlorophyll a determination that always take an entire work day. Because of the time and energy needed to do chlorophyll a analysis for all 80 sites, data is mostly only recorded once a month at each location. This means that current data collection procedures do not produce enough results to be able to investigate. With a method of gathering this data that involves simply visiting a site and dipping a fluorometer into the water you wish to test, much more can be done in the fight to protect our waterways. Manatee County can use this access to loads more data to develop highly accurate and up to date systems for not only monitoring algae levels across the county, but developing the best strategies to prevent and control algae populations.\nFluorometers serve as an efficient method to record values of chlorophyll a concentration in both fresh and saltwater, by emitting UV light and recording the irradiance emitted as a result of the light interaction with phytoplankton light harvesting complexes. Although this is possible, it is not an EPA approved method of measuring chlorophyll a concentration due to too much variance. Instead, the EPA approved method entails taking samples back to a lab where acetone is used to dissolve all cells and material, leaving chlorophyll a in the sample where concentration can be verifiably measured using a fluorometer. Thus, one goal of this project is to collect enough data from both field fluorometer measured chlorophyll a concentration and EPA approved measurements of chlorophyll a concentration. These two data sets are to be used to determine a correction factor that can be implemented to achieve the goal of creating an EPA approved method of chlorophyll a data collection using fluorometric field recordings. This would allow for more efficient data collection meaning the RAMP and SWAMP sites could be tested weekly for eutrophication levels. If this is achieved, the EPD can investigate how weather events and certain environmental protection efforts are affecting levels of eutrophication in surrounding waterways. One effort made by the Manatee County Government to reduce eutrophication is street sweeping to reduce nutrients washed into the waterways after storms. In one area encompassing a section of Bowlee’s Creek where two SWAMP stations exist, street sweeping has been doubled. If field fluorometer data could be verifiable, street sweeping statistics recorded by sweeping vehicles could be used in accordance with weekly, or even biweekly, chlorophyll a concentration to show the effects of street sweeping efforts on eutrophication in Manatee County’s waterways and be used to implement these efforts across the county. Many other efforts to decrease nutrient loading could be tested as well as the effects of ecological events if field fluorometer measurements can become an EPA approved method of chlorophyll a concentration measurement.\n\n\nMethodology\n[methodology section]\n\n\nResults\n\nLinear Regression: Field vs. Lab Measurements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth Tests: Measurement Error by Recording Depth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoric Range of Normal Algal Levels\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation\nHigher End CI\n\n\n\n\n11.36933\n37.49641\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection Value Scatter plot: Corrected vs. Uncorrected Methodology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement Range: Lab vs. Field Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n[conclusion section]\n\n\nReferences\n[references section]"
