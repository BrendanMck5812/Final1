    "text": "Correcting Field Fluorometer Data Accuracy for Efficient Algal level Monitoring\n\nManatee County Natural Resources Department-Environmental Protection Division; Intern Brendan McKnight\n\n\n\nNarrative\nIn Florida waterways, algae blooms have become a common threat to the environment and the citizens of Florida. Algae blooms release chemicals into the air and water that can harm humans and kill lots of wildlife, therefore, algae level monitoring has become a necessary protocol for environmental agencies. The current method of determining algae levels is not very time and labor efficient and involves taking samples from sites and analyzing them in a lab. Current field equipment has the capabilities to determine algae levels, however it’s accuracy remains an issue due to how it works. This project investigated the accuracy of this equipment and formulated a methodology to be able to gather reliable data on algae levels efficiently while in the field. With this new method, environmental agencies can determine algae levels and respond to them faster, as well as better investigate the causes of these blooms and the best actions to prevent it.\n\n\nAbout\nAn important aspect of water quality is nutrient and algae levels, When there are lots of nutrients in the water, algae populations explode causing harmful algae blooms. It is very important that government and environmental agencies can quickly and accurately monitor levels to take action and inform citizens of dangers to air quality, drinking water, seafood, etc. The Environmental Protection Agency as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fund programs aimed at investigating the ecology, monitoring, event response, and prevention and control of harmful algal blooms. These programs emphasize the importance for scientists to have access to efficient methods of accurate data collection to be able to investigate and respond quickly, as well as to produce more data for better investigation. This project aims to support that same agenda by developing a methodology for using field fluorometers that gives scientists an accurate way to determine the algae level of a waterway without having to take any samples back to a lab for analysis.\nThe Manatee County Natural Resources department has two programs that assess water quality both off the coast of Tampa and Sarasota Bay, as well as in freshwater systems that lead into those bays. These programs are named the Regional Ambient Monitoring Program (RAMP) and Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP). There are 80 sites in total between the two programs where water quality is regularly assessed. Chlorophyll a analysis must be carried out to determine the concentration of algae in the water during these assessments. This involves over 9 different processes from sample event to chlorophyll a determination that always take an entire work day. Because of the time and energy needed to do chlorophyll a analysis for all 80 sites, data is mostly only recorded once a month at each location. This means that current data collection procedures do not produce enough results to be able to investigate. With a method of gathering this data that involves simply visiting a site and dipping a fluorometer into the water you wish to test, much more can be done in the fight to protect our waterways. Manatee County can use this access to loads more data to develop highly accurate and up to date systems for not only monitoring algae levels across the county, but developing the best strategies to prevent and control algae populations.\nFluorometers serve as an efficient method to record values of chlorophyll a concentration in both fresh and saltwater, by emitting UV light and recording the irradiance emitted as a result of the light interaction with phytoplankton light harvesting complexes. Simply put, they send out light and record how much light is reflected back, which is representative of the density of phytoplankton in the water by chlorophyll a concentration. The more commonly used method uses a fluorometer, however this fluorometer requires preparation of samples and is laboratory bound. This method is used instead because its accuracy is verified and there are no interfering factors that can alter data. Despite this, the time needed to collect, transport, filter, freeze, and prepare samples makes this method too inefficient to consistently monitor algae levels. Therefore, it would be beneficial to investigate the data collection trends and results using the field based fluorometer to formulate a procedure for efficient algae monitoring with adequate data accuracy.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nQuality Assurance\n\n\nEquipment and Supplies\nGeneral\n\nCounty vehicle\nGPS/Cell phone\nStations map\nField data sheet and pens\n\nIn-Situ Data Collection\n\nEureka Manta2 multiprobe \nCounty laptop with Manta2 control software\nManta2 underwater cable\nBluetooth connection device\nStorage/Calibration cup\nTesting cup\n\nWater Sample Collection\n\nWater collection device (bucket, dipping rod sampler, VanDorn Bottle)\n500 mL amber Nalgene sample C bottles for chlorophyll (pre-labeled for each station)\nInsulated cooler and ice\nVacuum pump with glass fiber filter\nAcetone solution\nLaboratory Fluorometer\nVortexer\nCentrifuge\nVials\n\n\n\nTimeline of Goals\n\nCollect data set from field measurements and collection that match with the lab analyzed chlorophyll a concentration, investigate any trends, compare field to lab measurements.\nConduct field collection and measurement aimed at determining the correct depth for accurate measurements, analyze data and set depth requirements.\nDetermine range of algae levels that you are confident in field measurement accuracy.\nConduct any remaining investigations of confounding factors if found in previous data trends.\nEmploy depth requirements and range of confidence to create data set from field measurements and collection that match with the lab analyzed chlorophyll a concentration. \nInvestigate the relationship between field and lab measurements, determine correction formula.\nImplement new field data collection method to increase data collection.\n\n\n\nCorrection Procedure\nFollow the steps and instructions below to correct fluorometer accuracy and develop a method of efficient data collection. The steps below match the timeline of goals outlined above. Find the instructions for in-situ data collection, sample collection, chlorophyll a analysis, and data formatting below in “Common Procedures”.\n\nUncorrected Data Collection\n\nConduct in-situ data collection and sample collection at site\nConduct chlorophyll a analysis in laboratory\nConduct data formatting \nUsing a scatterplot, investigate the relationship between water parameters/measurement statistics and the correction factor (this set of data will not show much due to variability from inaccuracy and improper methods of data collection, is important to show how variability is different between uncorrected and corrected methods of data collection)\n\nDepth Analysis\nBecause the fluorometer determines the concentration of chlorophyll a based off of the light that is hitting its sensors, light coming from the sun can affect the measurement. To collect data that is free of interference from, the depth at which sunlight is no longer a factor must be determined. This depth may be different for environments with different conditions, for example, in my testing, different salinity/conductivity environments had different depth requirements. This is because of a couple of reasons. One is that freshwater is a lot more clear than brackish or salt water, so sunlight travels further in the water causing freshwater depth requirements to be at depths closer to the bottom. However, salt water, because of the higher conductivity, is not as clear, and so sunlight dissipates quicker. Along with this, certain salt water bottoms can be lightly colored which can affect the measurements. This makes closer to the surface the proper depth requirement for salt water. Brackish water, because of its mix between the two, shows a depth between the two depths of salt and fresh water.\n\nConduct water sample collection at site where data collection will be taken from (suggested to take twice the normal amount of samples, during my testing I took 6 samples per depth analysis)\nConduct rounds of in-situ data collection at separate depths until reach bottom/depth limit, keep differences between depths equal(My tests were conducting from depths 0.15-0.75 meters with intervals of 0.15 meters\nConduct data formatting\nCreate a column that is called “Error” and set it equal to the absolute value of the difference between the field determined chlorophyll a concentration and the lab determined concentration.\nCreate a scatterplot with X set as “Depth” and Y as “Error”, determine the depth at which error is the least and the range of error is the least, this is the depth at which you will record measurements\nRepeat depth analysis at locations that represent different conditions, I analyzed the correct depth at locations of freshwater, brackish water, and salt water\n\nRange of Confidence\nOne of the trends I began seeing when going through the data was that the higher the chlorophyll a concentration, the more error between the field and lab determined concentrations. Through analyzing data it became clear that when a bloom was occurring, the fluorometer was under estimating the concentration and had much more variability than normal, not only in the field determined concentration but also the lab determined concentration. Because of this, A range must be set of the chlorophyll a concentrations that the fluorometer can accurately read. To formulate this range, I took historic records of chlorophyll a in the waterways I was testing and determined a 95% confidence interval at 37.5 ug/L to be my upper limit. This is a confounding factor for this project but may not be for yours, make sure to investigate your data to find any confounding factors that are relevant to your project. The data at your disposal may be different and you will most likely have to formulate your own method to determining your own range.\nRemaining Confounding Factors\nAs mentioned before, it is important to go through your data as you are collecting it and investigate any relationships that may end up being confounding factors you have to come up with requirements for. This may involve developing your own method to investigate these confounding factors.\nCorrected Method Data Collection\n\nConduct in-situ data collection and sample collection at site \n\nUse depth requirements set previously\nOnly include observations within range of confidence\nFollow any other requirements formed\n\nConduct chlorophyll a analysis in laboratory\nConduct data formatting\n\nCorrection Formula\n\nCreate a scatter plot with X set as the field determined chlorophyll concentration and Y set as the lab determined concentration\nSet a linear trendline and determine the R squared value\n\nIf R squared value is not adequate, go back and investigate data further and develop more requirements\n\nUse trendline as correction formula, put field determined chlorophyll concentration in as X and Y will equal the corrected value\n\nImplement new field data collection method to increase data collection\n\nEmploy measurement techniques/requirements and apply correction formula to data to employ this method and accurately monitor chlorophyll levels and subsequent algae levels\n\n\n\n\nCommon Procedures\n\nIn-Situ Data Collection\n\nCalibrate Manta2 multiprobe, including fluorometer pink post-it standardization\n\nSee SOP for fluorometer standardization\n\nDepart for SWAMP stations\nConnect Manta2 cable to Bluetooth device and pair Bluetooth device to county laptop and open Manta2 control software\nRemove storage/calibration cup and place testing cup on the end of the Manta2 multiprobe\nDrop Manta2 multiprobe into water, holding onto the cable, confirm data readings are stable, then click “Capture One Line of Data to PC with Annotation” and note the station number and the depth measured\nPull Manta2 multiprobe out of the water, place storage/calibration cup with water on the end of the probe.\nWrite down any necessary notes, pack up and repeat at next station\nOnce all stations have been tested, save snapshot files to computer for statistical analysis\n\nWater Sample Collection\n\nPrepare 500 mL sample bottles with appropriate labels for each station\nPrepare insulated cooler with ice and place bottles inside and load into county vehicle\nDepart for SWAMP stations\nGather bottle labeled for specific station, along with water collection device upon arrival\nRinse sample bottles 3 times with water being collected\nPour collected water sample into 500 mL sample bottle, seal sample bottle\nPlace samples in insulated cooler with ice to preserve them while other SWAMP stations are visited for testing\nRepeat steps 4-7 for each station being visited, then transport samples back to laboratory\n\nChlorophyll a Analysis\n\nOnce back in laboratory, lay out samples, let come to room temperature\nFilter sample (125 mL) through a glass fiber filter using a vacuum pump\nStore resulting filter in acetone solution (90%, 8 mL), vortex sample to dissolve filter into acetone, place in fridge for 2 hours minimum (can go to 24 hours max) (or frozen at or below -20 degrees Celsius for 20 days)\nAfter 2 hours, vortex sample again, then centrifuge sample to settle any suspended solids\nPour sample into cuvette and place in fluorometer to get chlorophyll a concentration measurement and record results\n\nData Formatting \n\nImport data from field measurements, keep any parameter recorded for investigation of trends\nCreate a column that notes the station/location where the measurement was made, as well as a column for the lab determined chlorophyll a concentration\nDuplicate each observation/row for how many samples were analyzed, make a column that notes the replicate number for each observation\nEnter lab determined chlorophyll a concentrations, enter the different sample measurements in the different replicates rows\nCreate a column called “Correction Factor” and make that cell be equal to the field determined chlorophyll a concentration divided by the lab determined concentration\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nLinear Regression: Field vs. Lab Measurements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth Tests: Measurement Error by Recording Depth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoric Range of Normal Algal Levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection Value Scatter plot: Corrected vs. Uncorrected Methodology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement Range: Lab vs. Field Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n[conclusion section]\n\n\nReferences\n\nManuals and SOP’s\n\nCorrecting Field Fluorometer Accuracy SOP\nCalibrating Eureka Manta2 Fluorometer\n\nPost-It Calibration Method SOP\nEureka Submersible Fluorometer Calibration Manual\nEureka Submersible Fluorometer User Manual\nEureka Submersible Fluorometer Optical Specification Guide\n\nEureka Manta Multiprobe Manual\nField Sample Collection SOP\nEPA Method 445.0 Chlorophyll a Determinations SOP"
